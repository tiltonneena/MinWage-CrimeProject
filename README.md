 Wealth inequality is often assumed to be tied to higher crime rates by many media commentators. Such assumptions drove my curiosity to perform this study, which looks into the direct connection between state minimum wage and state incarceration rates, along with the direct connection between state minimum wage and state rate of violent crimes. 

 ## Objective
 The goal of this study was to uncover if state minimum wage had any direct impact on the incarceration rate and violent crime rate. Linear relationship was tested by way of performing linear regression and data grouping was tested by way of performing k-means clustering. 


 ## Data
 - The dataset of minimum wage for each state per year spanned from 1968 to 2017. It was accessed through Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lislejoem/us-minimum-wage-by-state-from-1968-to-2017?resource=download). The dataset figures were compiled from U.S. Department of Labor public website. 
 - The dataset of crimes and incarceration by state per year spanned from 2001 to 2017. It was also accessed through Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/christophercorrea/prisoners-and-crime-in-united-states?select=ucr_by_state.csv). The dataset are figures taken from public data provided by the Bureau of Justice Statistics.
